I made this package "Windows-only" because it requires the 'BH' package on 
Unix, and this package throws a warning.


## Testing environments

* local R-4.2.1 on Windows 10
* win-builder devel
* R-4.2.1 on Ubuntu 20 with and without Valgrind (via Github action)


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
